Interactive Installation for Christina Mamakos to be exhibited at RCA Biennale 2015 in London. Realised using a simple Processing sketch and ultrasonic distance sensors.

*Distance from guests to the projection on the wall controls pixelation/posterization of image and sound volume. Also sample sounds will be triggered if people trespass certain distance values. From the distance, the visuals are clear and natural - the closer you get to it, the more abstract and louder it gets.*
